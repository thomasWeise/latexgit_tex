\section{First File}%
First, we load a file from the GitHub repository
``\url{https://github.com/thomasWeise/latexgit\_py}'', where the
Python complement package of our \LaTeX\ package is located.
We will then include this file verbatim without any modification.

\gitLoad{https://github.com/thomasWeise/latexgit_py}{%
latexgit/utils/console.py}{}%
% now, \gitFile and \gitUrl are defined and can be used.
\verbatiminput{\gitFile}%  print the contents of the file
The above file was loaded from URL \url{\gitUrl}.%  print the url
%
\clearpage\section{Second File}%
We now load the same file again, but this time retain only the first
five lines. We do this by specifying that the file contents should be
piped through ``\verb=head -n 5='' before inclusion.
\gitLoad{https://github.com/thomasWeise/latexgit_py}{%
latexgit/utils/console.py}{head -n 5}%
% now, \gitFile and \gitUrl are defined and can be used.
\verbatiminput{\gitFile}%  print the contents of the file
The above file was loaded from URL \url{\gitUrl}.%  print the url
%
\clearpage\section{Third File}%
We now load a file from the ``\url{https://github.com/thomasWeise/moptipy}''
GitHub repository. The contents of this file will be piped through the
Python code formatter, which retains only a snippet of the code and
removes type hints and comments, while keeping the doc strings.
(It doesn't really matter what it does, it is just postprocessing.)
\gitLoad{https://github.com/thomasWeise/moptipy}{%
moptipy/api/encoding.py}{%  3rd argument below: formatter
python3 -m latexgit.formatters.python --labels book --args doc%

% now, \gitFile and \gitUrl are defined and can be used.
